                <h5>Student</h5>
                <p><br>Hi! My name is Patricia Anne Marie D. Go. I'm 21 years old and I am a Computer Science student at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. As you can tell from the background, I am in love with Japan. My goal is to settle down in Japan when im older. I regularly consume an unhealthy amount of caffeine and I also spend most of my days locked up in my room either playing games or watching netflix. <br> <br> </p>

        <h1>My Goals</h1>
        <img src = "images/game.jpg">
        <p>When I grow up, I want to live in Japan. I want to work for a Tech Company there in the field of either Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, or Game Development. That is my plan A. However, back then, I've always planned on pursuing Taekwondo. I wanted to become a professional athlete and/or study Sports Medicine. I guess I had to go down a different path. Now, I dream of creating a virtual world or a virtual game wherein I, the player, can do anything I want. Much like in Sword Art Online or Ready Player One, I want to create my own version of reality where I can do anything or become anything I want.<br><br><br><br><br> end.<br>thank you for visiting my page :D<br><br></p>
