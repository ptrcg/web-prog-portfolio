                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Datu Anuarudin P. Piang II, but most people just call me
                “Dats” and the closer of them call me “Meg” or “Migoy”. As of right
                now and as of writing this, I am a second year EMC student studying
                at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. I am equipped with various basic
                multimedia skills such as photo editing, video editing, and sound
                editing. All of which I learned in my spare time pursuing particular
                hobbies. I am also an avid consumer of anime and manga, but as of right
                now, my obsession is with webtoons. Silent and observant is what best
                describes me MOST OF THE TIME. The only times I am not that, is when
                I’m with friends. Being with friends bring me joy and laughter, which
                in turn causes me to be an absolutely obnoxious moron capable of
                silencing an entire room with my voice alone. I forgot to mention
                my abysmally tiny temper. Yes, I am aware of my short-temperedness, I
                do my best to control it. But at times I just need to scream and shout
                and let it all out. (That was definitely a song lyric from somewhere)
                My friends are also aware of this fact, and use it to their advantage
                to provoke me constantly. But I don’t really mind, since at the end of
                the day we’re all laughing and having fun.</p>

                <h2>My Goals and Aspirations</h2>
                <p>By my 30th year of existence, I hope to be doing well. I hope that I’m
                healthy and living the life I want. I hope to achieve my aspiration of
                publishing a fun multiplayer game for everyone to enjoy. I don’t have
                any grandiose goals in mind, I like to keep things simple and uncomplicated.</p>
